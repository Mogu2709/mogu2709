## 👋 Hi, I'm Mogu

I'm a UI/UX Designer and Web Enthusiast with a strong interest in building clean, functional, and user-centered digital experiences. I enjoy turning ideas into simple and responsive web projects while continuously improving my skills through hands-on practice.

Currently, I focus on UI/UX design, frontend fundamentals, and personal web-based projects. I believe good design is not only about aesthetics, but also about usability, clarity, and problem-solving.

🚀 Always learning, experimenting, and growing step by step.
